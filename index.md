Hi, my name is Brian Sinkovec and I'm an enthusiastic software engineer from Aachen, Germany.
I graduated from [RWTH Aachen](https://rwth-aachen.de) univserity in 2023 and obtained my masters degree in computer science with honors.
Besides being a nerd, I like coffee, hiking, martial arts, Marvel, and probably a lot more.

Here are four facts about me:
* Most interested in DevOps and security a.k.a. **DevSecOps**.
* Proficient in Java + Spring Boot, cloud technologies like k8s, and a few other things :seedling: :cloud:.
* Clean code and *-as-code enthusiast. Strives to [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (like this website :wink:).
* Always forgets the fourth one...

Feel free to [contact](mailto:bsin1807@gmail.com) me.
Except you're a bot.
Or a lizard.
Then don't.
