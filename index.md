# About

Hi, my name is Brian Sinkovec, currently studying computer science for my master degree at RWTH Aachen university.  
I am interested in theoretical computer science and software development. 

Here are some of my projects I built in my free-time
* [Foodbro](https://github.com/sinkovec/foodbro), a small android app to store the your own family recipes (yummy!)
* [revealjs-docker](https://github.com/sinkovec/revealjs-docker), a docker setup to simplify use with reveal.js
* My [dotfiles](https://github.com/sinkovec/dotfiles)
