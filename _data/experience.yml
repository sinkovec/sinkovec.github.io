    In my current position, I work as an software engineer with a focus on DevOps to maintain and extend Content Management System (CMS) solutions for our customers.
    We primarily use the [CoreMedia](https://www.coremedia.com) CMS to provide customers and end-users a smooth and flexible customer experience.
    CoreMedia CMS uses Java, Spring Boot and Spring Web MVC as a basis, and thus, I gained solid experience in web development with this setup.
    I possess robust expertise in abstracting and layering architectural designs, ensuring clean, maintainable, and testable code and thus contribute to the sustainable growth of our systems.

    From a DevOps perspective, I'm responsible for keeping a smooth developer experience and thus strive to improve our pipelines and clusters continuouosly.
    Presently, I'm actively steering our transition towards a GitOps model powered by Argo CD. Although this approach isn't yet operational, it represents our envisioned future and the direction we're diligently working towards.
    Furthermore, we employ Azure's APIM solution to centralize the management and governance of our APIs.
    I'm responsible to transition our deployment and collaboration model to an APIOps methodology inspired by the Azure team.

    My approach to work is driven by personal engagement and a relentless pursuit of improvement. 
    I actively challenge existing processes and tools, striving to foster a culture of continuous improvement within the team. 
    Sharing and gaining knowledge among colleagues is a core value, and there's a personal sense of fulfillment in developing or refactoring code to leave behind a more robust and refined codebase.
