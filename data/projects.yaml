academic:
  - name: 'Master thesis: Towards a software engineering view of security for microservice-based applications'
    highlights:
      - Tackled the question how the security of software architectures can be modeled from a software engineering perspective and which security design concepts exist to be modeled in such security views
      - Performed a systematic literature review to collect, select, review, and classify 52 out of 538 scientific publications about secure software design
      - Developed automation scripts in Python to transfer and label publication metadata from Mendeley/Bibtex into Notion
      - Extracted and classified 119 security design concepts into a comprehensive catalog with 6 different categories and corresponding properties, e.g., security tactics, design principles, protocols, etc.
      - Created a meta-model to define security views and concerns for security modeling of software applications
      - Interviewed and discussed the approach of modeling security views and concerns with research and domain experts
      - My contribution directly led to a new research project called "SCAM - Security-Centered Architecture Modelling" under which my former mentor researches and supervises new thesis projects at RWTH Aachen University

  - name: Operations Resarch Internship
    highlights:
      - Collaborated in an interdisciplinary team to address an industry challenge related to optimizing schematic network diagrams for electrical networks.
      - Formalized the problem of finding an optimal orhtogonal visualization of a hierarchical graph as Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP)
      - Developed a system that transforms a graph with geographical data into a set of constraints and objectives to be solved by the Gurobi MILP solver
      - Presented to academic and industry experts our solutions capability to find optimized graph representations minimizing total area of the graph, interconnection crossings, and location overlaps for certain graph instances
